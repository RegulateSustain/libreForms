signing.py: function set for managing signing keys and corresponding database operations

Signing keys, or signatures, are used in various situations to authenticate a 
user when logging in - or even registering an account - are not reasonable
expectations, but where we would still like to be able to strongly authenticate
a user before a privileged behavior is permitted by the application. This script 
defines a set of operations to generate and manage these signatures using the 
signing database defined in app/models.py, which is a useful script to review 
for more information on the data model. 

# Scope

One point from the data model that will be useful to discuss here is the signature's 
`scope`, which is a field that describes the purpose of a given signature. We employ 
a mixed approach when using a `scope` to constrain a signature's use. For 
example, a signature's scope will not, in itself, be used to set the signature's 
expiration behavior - that is set when write_key_to_database() is invoked and
is defined alongside the signature's scope, see below for more information.
What this means in practice is that the end user retains the freedom to 
set the expiration behavior of different scopes or subsets of scopes. 

However, to prevent improper use of signatures, scopes may not be used for
interchangeable purposes, such that a signature with a scope of 'forgot_password'
cannot be used in an application function requiring a scope of 'email_verification'.
This is a common sense rule that is enforced through some boilerplate that should
be run everytime a signature is invoked. Take, for example, the following code from
app/auth.py, which verifies that a signature exists, that it is active and unexpired,
and that it contains the appropriate scope. Feel free to repurpose the code below for
additional views that may require signature validation. 

```
    if not Signing.query.filter_by(signature=signature).first():
        flash('Invalid request key. ')
        return redirect(url_for('auth.forgot_password'))

    # if the signing key's expiration time has passed, then set it to inactive 
    if Signing.query.filter_by(signature=signature).first().expiration < datetime.datetime.timestamp(datetime.datetime.now()):
        signing.expire_key(signature)

    # if the signing key is set to inactive, then we prevent the user from proceeding
    # this might be redundant to the above condition - but is a good redundancy for now
    if Signing.query.filter_by(signature=signature).first().active == 0:
        flash('Invalid request key. ')
        return redirect(url_for('auth.forgot_password'))

    # if the signing key is not scoped (that is, intended) for this purpose, then 
    # return an invalid error
    if not Signing.query.filter_by(signature=signature).first().scope == "forgot_password":
        flash('Invalid request key. ')
        return redirect(url_for('auth.forgot_password'))
```


Some scopes that this application implements - primarily located in app/auth.py
and app/api.py, are:

1.  api_key: the base application sets the expiration date at 365 days, and does not expire
    the key after a given use by default, though it does allow administrators to limit the 
    number of API keys a single user / email may register. 

2.  forgot_password: the base application sets the expiration date at 1 hour, and expires the
    key after a single use.

3.  email_verification: the base application sets the expiration date at 48 hours, and expires 
    the key after a single use.
