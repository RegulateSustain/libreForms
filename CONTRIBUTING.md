## How to contribute to libreForms

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/signebedi/libreForms/issues) with the \[bug\] tag.

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/signebedi/libreForms/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring. Make sure to use the \[bug\] tag

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are solely cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of libreForms will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change under [Issues](https://github.com/signebedi/libreForms/issues) with the \[enhancement\] tag before making any pull requests.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use libreForms under [Issues](https://github.com/signebedi/libreForms/issues) with the \[question\] tag.

#### **Do you want to contribute to the libreForms documentation?**

* Suggest your change under [Issues](https://github.com/signebedi/libreForms/issues) with the \[documentation\] tag before making any pull requests.

#### **Are there general approaches to how commits and PRs should be made?**

Git commits should generally be prepended with the following conventions (with major conventions bolded):

- **Added**: a catch-all for additions to the code base
- **Removed**: dropping a significant component of an existing feature
- **Changed**: a modification to a current feature of the codebase
- **Fixed**: a broken feature or bug fix
- **Docs**: modified the codebase documentation
- **Tests**: modified the codebase tests
- Routine: clerical and minor changes or refactors not affecting the API
- Grumble: progress not yet sufficient to result in any changes above

Generally, contributors should aim to link all of their contributions to [Issues](https://github.com/signebedi/libreForms/issues) to help with code review. This entails appending an issue number to any contribution message. 

Thanks for your interest in the libreForms project.
